-- CLASS SCHEDULE SYSTEM --

Here I developed a class schedule system that notifies students and teachers
about the information of a class such as course no., topic name, teacher name and date
with time (24-hour format).

I have made two display elements, TeacherDisplay and
StudentDisplay. 

Whenever data changes, the display elements are notified with new data, and they
display the latest data accordingly.
